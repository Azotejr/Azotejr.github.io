      <p style="text-indent: 3em">(This is my very boring and awkwardly written artist statement. Don't read it.)</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 3em">I mainly work as a graphic designer. For me, I see my designs as solutions. They are solutions that best communicates with the audience, delivering the information in easiest and simplest way possible. I tend to help the client to compress and simplify the message they want to conceive, and present it in the most direct and straightforward way for the audience to perceive.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 3em">I believe that designers have to have their own idea or philosophy when they work. For me, a simple and clear design looks always better, as I believe that the first priority of design is to make it clear to the audience and communicate well with them.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 3em">Typography and color play very important roles in my work. I believe the power of idiosyncrasies in different typefaces and colors can influence people slowly but effectively. They work in a imperceptive way on suggesting a subtle idea, thus enforce the main purpose of the design. As a result, color choice and use of fonts are areas that I focus the most in my work.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 3em">I do not have a preferred style in the filed of graphic design since I don’t want to frame myself in a single way of producing designs. As Pablo Picasso said, “Ah, good taste! What a dreadful thing! Taste is the enemy of creativeness.” I want to be brave, bold, and open-minded to all the possibilities that can inspire me.</p>
